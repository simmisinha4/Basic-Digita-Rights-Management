# Basic Digital Rights Management

## Project Description

This project implements a simple digital rights management system using Soroban smart contracts. It allows creators to register digital content and transfer ownership rights securely on-chain.

## Project Vision

To provide a decentralized, transparent, and tamper-proof way of managing digital content rightsâ€”empowering creators and reducing infringement risks in a trustless environment.

## Key Features

- **Content Registration**: Creators can register their work with title and URI metadata.
- **Ownership Tracking**: The contract stores and verifies ownership of each piece of content.
- **Ownership Transfer**: Owners can transfer their content rights to another address.
- **Content Query**: Anyone can fetch content metadata and verify ownership.
- **Total Registry Count**: Retrieve the number of registered digital works on-chain.
